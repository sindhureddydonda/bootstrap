	<p style=" color: black;   font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;" > <br><br>I am Sindhu and I want to share a small story here, since I was a little girl I had a very dry skin, it was more like gene as my parents had a very dry skin too even though i lived in India which more like warm according to the weather and my surroundings it never heleped with my dry skin and then when I grew up and then it started becoming a lot poblem in compared to wheni was a child, as my skin peel out and 
	I had all dry skin patches on face and it used to burn and irritate a lot until then skin care was never a thing to me and I started using skin care products and I realised that my skin is very sensetive 
	and instantly shows reaction such as rashes and red stops all over my face mainly when I use sunscreen. So it took years for me to figure out what products are right for me, with all the trial 
	and error process, and finally at the age of 22 I finally tell what my skin needs and using what I can care of it. So here I'm sharing something i tried and 
	works amazing for me and hoping i works for you to if you have similar problem as I do.  (I never had acne problems and had a very clear skin but once i came to usa maybe due to region and weather change my skin started 
	reacting bad thats how i started my skin journey with the help of my elder sister who is a doctor).
